Kevin used the SBL04 motors from Namiki for the Triad drives.
These are no longer manufactured. He has a small number of spares.
The datasheet is for the SBL07 through SBL12 motors.
These are three-phase stepper motors, it looks like.

Update:
Kevin says they're brushless DC motors, not steppers. The UVW inputs take
sine waves 120 degrees out of phase from each other, with the phase order
determining the motor directions, at +/- 3V.


Further update (18 March 2021):

The datasheet lists U, V, W, and common connections to the motor ribbon flex,
in the order "W", "com", "U", "V". Kevin soldered these in the opposite order
(W,c,U,V looking at the dark side of the flex rather than the copper side).
He also left "common" unconnected on the ribbon and wrapped the cable's
shielding braid around the motor housings instead.

Since the drives worked, I'll assume the datasheet's drawing was misleading
and that the motor coils are delta-connected rather than wye-connected.
